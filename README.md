## Titanic Survival Prediction Project

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict Titanic passengers' survival using machine learning. Python's data science libraries are utilized for data analysis, visualization, model building, and performance evaluation.

### Dataset
The dataset includes passenger details like age, sex, class, fare, and survival status. It is split into a training set for model training and a test set for evaluation.

### How to Run the Notebook in Google Colab
1. **Open Google Colab**: Log in with your Google account.
2. **Upload Notebook**: Upload `notebook.ipynb` to Colab.
3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute each cell by selecting it and pressing Shift + Enter.

### Required Python Packages
The project uses:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

These are pre-installed in Google Colab.

### Data Description
Columns in the dataset:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger's name
- **Sex**: Passenger's sex
- **Age**: Passenger's age
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Fare paid
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Troubleshooting
Ensure the dataset is correctly uploaded to Colab and the necessary packages are imported if issues arise.

Happy analyzing!
